        <h4>The <em>main types</em> of strength training include:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Muscular hypertrophy.</strong> Also known as muscle
            building, this type of strength training uses moderate-to-heavy
            weights to stimulate muscle growth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Muscular endurance.</strong> This refers to your muscles'
            ability to sustain exercise for a period of time. Training to
            increase muscular endurance usually involves high reps using light
            weights or body weight.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Circuit training.</strong> During this form of full-body
            conditioning, you cycle through various exercises with little to no
            rest between them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Maximum muscular strength.</strong> This type of exercise
            involves low reps (usually 2-6) and heavy weights to improve your
            overall strength. It's best reserved for experienced exercisers who
            have mastered their form.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Explosive power.</strong> This training combines power and
            speed to improve your power output. It's usually employed among
            trained athletes to improve their ability to perform explosive
            movements in their sport.
